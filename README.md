# Motivation
I'm currently going through an accelerator programme known as Entrpreneur First(EF) and I realized that I've had to reintroduce myself multiple times. I'd like to speed up with this README. Idea taken from [swyx](https://github.com/sw-yx/README).I'm hoping that this will help me cultivate stronger relationships by allowing people to know more details about me at an accelerated pace.


## Who are you
- Grew up in Singapore, served in the army for a two years. In high school I aspired to be a clinician-scientist and worked in a lab but ultimately decided to study computer science.

- I studied Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. Briefly did a Master's at the department of Statistics before taking leave to join an accelerator program(where I'm at now).

- I spent time at Yitu, Shopee, Peanut Robotics, and PlanetScale. I am indebted to the kindness that PlanetScale has shown me.

- I contribute to a few open source projects as a means of improving my code quality + giving back.


## Beliefs?
- Default to Open
- Start with the internal motivation. I want to care about what I'm working on.


## What I'm working on now
- I'm interested in understanding how LiveView and Phoenix Internals work. I want to eventually make tutorials out of them.

## Known Failure modes
- I love to start new things but often underestimate the amount of time taken to do things. Please be patient with me -- I'm trying to fix this.
- I can overthink about certain issues.

## Work Habits
- I wake up early, sometimes at 5am. I try not to directly people so they don't get notifications but don't be surprised if you receive notifications from me then.


## Meetings
- I prefer to have contiguous meetings rather than swiss cheese style meetings. I quite like [Paul Graham's essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) (yes, it's yet another PG-quoting person) about a maker's schedule as opposed to a manager's schedule. As such, back-to-back meetings are great!
- Please do let me know early if you'd like to reschedule meetings. I like to know what I have to do in advance and I use my calendar as a source of truth -- can be a little disorienting to have meetings rescheduled.
- I donâ€™t like having 1:1s delayed for more than a week.

## Feedback
- Please feel free to give me feedback anytime. I really appreciate getting specific examples of my behaviors and how they impact people. So it'd be really helpful if you could include those -- I have an anonymous feedback form set up here. I like the Nonviolent Communication framework. Here's a link where you can [drop me feedback] (j0.github.io/feedback)

## Communication

- I aspire to read emails only at the start and the end of the day. In general, if you need something urgently do try to Slack me or Telegram me instead.
- I generally don't read the subthreads so if there's a PDF or item that needs immediate action do try to highlight in the email text.
- Feel free to send/forward me emails even if you don't know it'll be directly relevant(e.g. related features from other products, interesting development in the newspaper).
- Feel free to overcommunicate -- I like having more information.

## Misc
Qn: J*oe*l or Jo*el*?
A: It's up to you, both are fine.
